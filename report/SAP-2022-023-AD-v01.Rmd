# Abbreviations

- CI: confidence interval
- KOOS: Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score
- OTC: Over the counter
- SD: standard deviation
- VAS: Visual analog scale

# Context

## Objectives

Quantify the association between KOOS increase and pain reduction, controlling for frequency of use of over-the-counter analgesic over a 4-week period.

## Hypotheses

In (P) patients 18 through 65 years old who suffer from medial osteoarthritis of the knee using an unloading knee brace, (I) the utilization of OTC analgesics (O) influences the KOOS score (T) over a 4-week period."

## Study design

Cross-sectional, change from baseline study.

# Data

## Raw data

The raw data base was received with KOOS and VAS pain measurements both at baseline and after the 4-week period of the study, as well as the weekly frequency of OTC analgesic use.
The original data base had
`r Nvar_orig`
variables collected on
`r Nobs_orig`
observations.

## Analytical dataset

From the pre and post measurements available in the raw data the differences between baseline and post KOOS scores were calculated, as well as the differences between baseline and post VAS pain scores.
Baseline characteristics were kept for the descriptive analysis of the study sample.

<!-- After the cleaning process -->
<!-- `r Nvar_final` -->
<!-- variables were included in the analysis -->
<!-- with -->
<!-- `r Nobs_final` -->
<!-- observations. -->
After the cleaning process
`r Nvar_final`
variables were included in the analysis.
The total number of observations excluded due to incompleteness and exclusion criteria will be reported in the analysis.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.

```{r analytical data}
analytical_mockup %>%
  pander(caption = "**Table 1** Analytical dataset structure after variable selection and cleaning.")
```

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
and clinical variables
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the
independent t test with Welch correction.
<!-- paired t test. -->
<!-- Wilcoxon test. -->
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
Fisher exact test.
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->

<!-- All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section). -->

### Statistical modeling

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.
